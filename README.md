<h3>Step 1: Ticket Intake (Submission)</h3>

<br />
<p>
<h3>Step 2: Ticket Assignment</h3>
1. Once the ticket is created, it is routed to an appropriate team or agent based on predefined rules or manual assignment.</p>
2. The system can automatically generate a ticket for specific agents and assign them unique ID's.</p>

<br />
<p>
<h3>Step 3: Ticket Categorization & Prioritization</h3>
1. Categories and priorities are assigned to the ticket to help organize the workflow. This could involve defining the severity of the issue (low, medium, high) and the type of request (example -> software issue, hardware issue, inquiry, etc.)</p>
2. The system can automate this step based on predefined rules, but agents can adjust the category or priority as necessary.</p>

<p>
<br />
<br />
<p>
<h3>Step 4: Ticket Investigation & Resolution</h3>
1. The assigned agent investigates the issue, asks for additional details if necessary, and works to resolve the request.</p>
2. This step may involve troubleshooting, researching solutions, communicating with other departments, or utilizing knowledge base articles to provide resolutions.</p>

<p>
<br />
<br />
<p>
<h3>Step 5: Customer Communication</h3>
1. Throughout the process, communication between the agent and the customer is maintained. This can happen via ticket updates, emails, or phone calls.</p>
2. The agent may ask for clarifications or inform the customer about progress. Customers can also provide feedback or additional information, if needed.</p>

<p>
<br />
<br />
<p>
<h3>Step 6: Ticket Closure</h3>
1. Once the issue is resolved, the agent will close the ticket after confirming with the customer that the resolution is satisfactory.</p>
2. The ticket is marked as closed in the osTicket system and closed tickets are archived but remain accessible for future reference.</p>
